  intro: 'Hi there!\nI’m a passionate and highly motivated software engineer who loves building new applications and working with technologies to streamline and enrich the lives of those around me by providing solutions that can be resolved through code as well as my ability to discern and dissect information. \nI enjoy solving problems that I see or hear around me by breaking things down into smaller digestible parts and coming up with multiple different approaches to potentially resolve them which led me to software engineering.\nMy teammates have told me that they appreciated the positive attitude and support that I brought to the team and how I uplift the individuals around me and assist in ways that I could that contributed to the team’s success.\nI contribute to teams I am a part of through my technical skills in JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Relational Databases and Non-relational databases, and RESTful API by writing thoroughly tested and clean code and providing timely solutions to complex problems.\nOutside of software engineering, I love to play video games, play or watch basketball and spend time with the people I love.\nI’m always up for a chat so feel free to DM me here on LinkedIn or email me at tigerhong186@gmail.com!'
